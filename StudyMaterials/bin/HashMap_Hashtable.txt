why hashTable doesn't supports null keys and values?
Ans:-
its legacy class
//Doesnot allow null keys
to get hashcode directly uses -> key.hashCode() --> null pointer exception

//Does not allow null values
incase of multi threaded environment if we are allowing null values
behaviour varies

Ex-

if(table.contains()){
   return table.get(key);
}else{
    throw Exception();
}

if t1 executes code and checks if key is there mean while(before executing table.get(key))
t2 removes key then correct answer is Exception but still we will get
