1)Difference between Restclient and webclient
Ans:-
rest client:
Synchronous and blocking client,
--> rest client uses the Java Servlet API, which is based on the thread-per-request model.
scenario - rest service is slow so when all the request hit the service all the requests are piled up and can be creating the problem
like exhausting thread pool and consumes all available memory.
-->performance degradation.

WEB CLIENT:
Asynchronous non-blocking client provided by spring reactive frame work
event driven architecture.
scenario:
how rest client creates thread, similar way web client create task for each even and behind the scenes
all the taskes are queued and executes them only when appropriate response is received.

example:-
RestTemplate t = new RestTemplate();
t.getforObject("uri",reqObj,respClass);
Sysos("completed executing");

o/p:-
first executes getForObject
and finally
completed executing

Flux<RespObj> = WebClient.create()
                .get()
                .uri("")
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToFlux(Resp.class);
