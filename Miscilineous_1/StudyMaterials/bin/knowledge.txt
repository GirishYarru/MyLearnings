//------------------
The two questions in Automata asked were :
1)Given an integer S and integers M, N find the value of ((S^M)%10)^N)%1000000007. The question is a modified form of this question.
Modular Exponentiation

2)Given a string remove all vowels in a string and return the string.
3)Rearrange array such that all odd numbers occupy odd positions and even numbers occupy even position. Order of numbers needs to be maintained without use of extra space
Reverse a string, Find middle of a linked list, Delete a node in the linked list, Dynamic programming coding questions, string manipulation questions and basic questions on binary tree and BST.
Balanced Trees, AVL Tree Deletion Insertion and other tree based questions.
OS and DBMS were basic questions. 



class A{
B b = new B();
}

if class b is not loaded --> class not found exception
if we use autowired

class A{

@Autowired
private B b;

}

2) sql case

3) sql native query and hibernate query

sql - compile time
hql - run time 


4)what is jpql

5)Runnable and callable
6)atoicity, atomic integer
  volatile --> directly access from memory
  Ex:-
  int a =10;
  threadt t1 --> access and make it as 11.
  Mean while thread t2 accessing ..and value is still 10(presennt in cache memory); so it also makes it as 11;
  
  in that case if we use volatile -> thread directly access it from memory
  7)difference between dead locak and race around condition

Oracle
1)method overloading
2)method overriding --> how to prevent call from parent class
3)static in method overriding
4)constructor types -> 
    constructor(int,char)
    constructor(char,int)
5)00001234 --> how to remove zeros with out iterating
6)Get,put,post,patch
7)private, protected,default,public
8)How to handle exceptions
9)Hash map - internal working
 can we insert objs in keys
10)static thread safe??


//-----2nd round
1)how is encapsulation feature of java
2)why getters and setters public
3)Serilization and deserilization
4)Abstract and interface examples
5)list[AYUSH,ayush,KEER,keer] --> find uniques strings in list with out for loop
