Creational Design patterns:
process of cretaing objects of a class.
Why to use creational design patterns instead of using new operator?
Some scenarios like need to do addition requriements for creating objects like:
1)Your object may need multiple other Objects before it is created
2)Multiple steps need to be done before creating objects like 
   itearting
   fetching data from file
   queriying database
3)need to create only one object for entire db ...etc
Types of creational design patterns
1)Builder
2)Simple factory
3)factory method
4)Abstractory factory
5)singleton
6)prototype
7)Singleton


1)Singleton:-
creating only one object per jvm
real time examples:- log4j
Rules:
i)static member
ii)private constructor
iii)factory method

Singleton ways :-
1)eager initialization
2)lazy initialization
4)Thread safe initialization
5)Reflection to destroy singleton
6)Serilization and singleton
